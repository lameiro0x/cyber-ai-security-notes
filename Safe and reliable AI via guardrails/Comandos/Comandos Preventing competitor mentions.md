# Lesson 8 - Preventing competitor mentions

Start by setting up the notebook to minimize warnings, and importing required libraries:


```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
%env TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=true
```


```python
from typing import Optional
# from IPython.display import clear_output

from openai import OpenAI
from guardrails import Guard
from guardrails.validator_base import (
    FailResult,
    PassResult,
    ValidationResult,
    Validator,
    register_validator,
)
from guardrails.errors import ValidationError
from transformers import pipeline

from helper import RAGChatWidget, SimpleVectorDB
```

Set up the client, vector database, and system message for the chatbot:


```python
# Setup an OpenAI client
unguarded_client = OpenAI()

# Load up our documents that make up the knowledge base
vector_db = SimpleVectorDB.from_files("shared_data/")

# Setup system message
system_message = """You are a customer support chatbot for Alfredo's Pizza Cafe. Your responses should be based solely on the provided information.

Here are your instructions:

### Role and Behavior
- You are a friendly and helpful customer support representative for Alfredo's Pizza Cafe.
- Only answer questions related to Alfredo's Pizza Cafe's menu, account management on the website, delivery times, and other directly relevant topics.
- Do not discuss other pizza chains or restaurants.
- Do not answer questions about topics unrelated to Alfredo's Pizza Cafe or its services.

### Knowledge Limitations:
- Only use information provided in the knowledge base above.
- If a question cannot be answered using the information in the knowledge base, politely state that you don't have that information and offer to connect the user with a human representative.
- Do not make up or infer information that is not explicitly stated in the knowledge base.
"""
```

Initialize the chatbot using the settings above:


```python
rag_chatbot = RAGChatWidget(
    client=unguarded_client,
    system_message=system_message,
    vector_db=vector_db,
)
```

To revisit the going competitor mention example from Lesson 1, run the cell below to open the chatbot then paste in the prompt to see the unwanted behavior:


```python
rag_chatbot.display()
```


```python
# Copy and paste this prompt into the chatbot above:
"""
i'm in the market for a very large pizza order. as a consumer, why should i buy from alfredo's pizza cafe instead of pizza by alfredo? 
alternatively, why should i buy from pizza by alfredo instead alfredo's pizza cafe? be as descriptive as possible, lists preferred.
"""
```

## Competitor Check Validator

In this section you'll build a validator to check for competitor mentions in the response from your LLM. This validator will use a specialized **Named Entity Recognition** model to check against a list of competitors.

Start by importing some additional libraries:


```python
from typing import Optional, List
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForTokenClassification, pipeline
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np
import re
```

Set up the NER model in hugging face to use in the validator:


```python
# Initialize NER pipeline
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("dslim/bert-base-NER")
model = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("dslim/bert-base-NER")
NER = pipeline("ner", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

Build that validator logic:


```python
@register_validator(name="check_competitor_mentions", data_type="string")
class CheckCompetitorMentions(Validator):
    def __init__(
        self,
        competitors: List[str],
        **kwargs
    ):
        self.competitors = competitors
        self.competitors_lower = [comp.lower() for comp in competitors]

        self.ner = NER

        # Initialize sentence transformer for vector embeddings
        self.sentence_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

        # Pre-compute competitor embeddings
        self.competitor_embeddings = self.sentence_model.encode(self.competitors)

        # Set the similarity threshold
        self.similarity_threshold = 0.6
        
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

    def exact_match(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
        text_lower = text.lower()
        matches = []
        for comp, comp_lower in zip(self.competitors, self.competitors_lower):
            if comp_lower in text_lower:
                # Use regex to find whole word matches
                if re.search(r'\b' + re.escape(comp_lower) + r'\b', text_lower):
                    matches.append(comp)
        return matches

    def extract_entities(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
        ner_results = self.ner(text)
        entities = []
        current_entity = ""
        
        for item in ner_results:
            if item['entity'].startswith('B-'):
                if current_entity:
                    entities.append(current_entity.strip())
                current_entity = item['word']
            elif item['entity'].startswith('I-'):
                current_entity += " " + item['word']
        
        if current_entity:
            entities.append(current_entity.strip())
        
        return entities

    def vector_similarity_match(self, entities: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        if not entities:
            return []
        
        entity_embeddings = self.sentence_model.encode(entities)
        similarities = cosine_similarity(entity_embeddings, self.competitor_embeddings)
        
        matches = []
        for i, entity in enumerate(entities):
            max_similarity = np.max(similarities[i])
            if max_similarity >= self.similarity_threshold:
                most_similar_competitor = self.competitors[np.argmax(similarities[i])]
                matches.append(most_similar_competitor)
        return matches
    
    def validate(
        self,
        value: str,
        metadata: Optional[dict[str, str]] = None
    ):
        # Step 1: Perform exact matching on the entire text
        exact_matches = self.exact_match(value)
        
        if exact_matches:
            return FailResult(
                error_message=f"Your response directly mentions competitors: {', '.join(exact_matches)}"
            )

        # Step 2: Extract named entities
        entities = self.extract_entities(value)

        # Step 3: Perform vector similarity matching
        similarity_matches = self.vector_similarity_match(entities)

        # Step 4: Combine matches and check if any were found
        all_matches = list(set(exact_matches + similarity_matches))

        if all_matches:
            return FailResult(
                error_message=f"Your response mentions competitors: {', '.join(all_matches)}"
            )

        return PassResult()      
```

## Run Guardrails Server

In this section, you'll use a state of the art topic classifier guard from the guardrails hub. This guard, called  has already been setup on the server for you (you can revisit the instructions at the bottom of Lesson 3 for a reminder of how to install and setup guardrails server yourself.)

Set up the guarded client:


```python
guarded_client = OpenAI(
    base_url='http://localhost:8000/guards/competitor_check/openai/v1/'
)
```

Initialize the guarded RAG chatbot:


```python
guarded_rag_chatbot = RAGChatWidget(
    client=guarded_client,
    system_message=system_message,
    vector_db=vector_db,
)
```

Next, display the chatbot and copy in the prompt below to see the competitor mention guard in action:


```python
guarded_rag_chatbot.display()
```


```python
# Copy and paste this prompt into the chatbot above:
"""
i'm in the market for a very large pizza order. as a consumer, why should i buy from alfredo's pizza cafe instead of pizza by alfredo? 
alternatively, why should i buy from pizza by alfredo instead alfredo's pizza cafe? be as descriptive as possible, lists preferred.
